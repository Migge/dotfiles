* Fonts

My setup is dependent on a font used by the terminal, namely
SourceCodePro (or Sauce Code Pro) from the Nerd Fonts collection. The
latest version is always available at the following link:

https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest/download/SourceCodePro.tar.xz

, and should be unpacked into a fonts directory of your choice. Since
I plan to include this in an upcoming script, the preferred location,
which is one of the default ones the system will look for, is the
~.fonts/~ directory in your home, as then the script won't require
root privileges.
